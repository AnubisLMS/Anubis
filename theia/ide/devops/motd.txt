- Remember, this Cloud IDE server is temporary!
  Make sure that your work is getting pushed to
  github. When the session is ended, everything
  (including your work) will be deleted.
- If you did not disable autosave, then every 5
  minutes your work will be pushed to github.
- Use the autosave command to manually trigger
  an autosave.
- For servers running in your ide, valid ports
  are 8000-8010. You can access them through
  your browser by specifying ports in the url

  The "/ide/proxy:8000" will be removed from the
  url before reaching your server.
