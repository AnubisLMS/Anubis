During the midterm this semester there were a few issues that came up. In this post,
I'm going to be explaining how I went about live patching the RPC queues while
the cluster was running and under load from users.

#### RPC in Anubis

[RPC, or remote procedural call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call)is the core of many modern distributed systems. Anubis is no different.We heavily rely on RPC to handle starting new Cloud IDE servers,
handling bulk regrades, and creating submission pipelines.

Every time you click regrade, push a commit, or start a Cloud IDE,
a job is put in the RPC queue. There is then a pool of workers in the
form of a [Kubernetes deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/). Each of these workers is constantly trying to dequeue and run the current job.

#### Bulk Regrades

A bulk regrade is where we regrade a large number of assignment submissions.
Any time the test cases change while an assignment is out, I will run a full
bulk regrade. These operations are probably when Anubis is under the highest
sustained load. Some assignments can get up to 5,000+ individual submissions
that would need to be regraded. On their own and over time, this is quite
minimal load. Even on the night of a deadline, there are rarely more than 3
concurrent submission jobs.

This is one of the places I have introduced artificial limits into Anubis. If
we were to say create a kubernetes job for each submission all at once, we will
reach limits within the kubernetes API quite quickly. It is much better to have
some set artificial limit of kubernetes submission jobs that can be running at
any time. We do this right in the RPC job. If there are too many jobs that are
running, then we re-enqueue the rpc job.

#### Midterm Perfect Storm

This setup worked just fine for quite a while. What got in the way was
scale. The majority of the time, the RPC queue is basically empty. It
is only when users are on, or there is a bulk regrade that there are items
in the queue.

Now consider the situation where there is a bulk regrade while there are
users online. This is the exact situation I found myself in while
the midterm was running. There were several changes to the assignment tests
that happened while the test was running. The midterm also only ran for
48 hours. This caused the perfect storm. There were consistently 50+
users online while I needed to run bulk regrade jobs.

The result of this situation was that the RPC queues were saturated with thousands
of individual submissions. This made it so that if you went to start a Cloud IDE,
the spinner would just keep spinning. _Let me demonstrate..._

![rpx-queue-1](/api/public/static/88a52255687d6d56)

Imagine this is our RPC queue while a bulk regrade is running. The ... is meant to
represent the hundreds if not several thousands of submission jobs in the queue at that time.
Now if someone clicks the button to start a new Cloud IDE at that time, then it would be thrown
into the same job queue.

![rpx-queue-2](/api/public/static/6474ac1290150bfc)

The problem is that the queue is much too saturated with the submission jobs. The start
theia job should have higher priority than a regrade job, but this model does not support
that. The job will sit in the queue for much too long while the student will become
frustrated. All they can see in this situation is the infinite spinner. For many
students, the Anubis Cloud IDE is what they rely on to do their OS work. If it does not
work, then they do not have or know how to set up an alternative environment.

This problem was something I had known about for a while. Despite this, this `perfect storm`
situation was so infrequent that it was something I deemed not worthy of the time to fix.
Whoops, that was that a mistake.

#### The Solution

The fix I choose to this problem was splitting the RPC system into two queue&apos;s and
two worker pools. What made this a highly stressful patch is that there were 50+
students on Cloud IDEs at this time. If the deploy was unsuccessful, or there was a new
bug introduced, then many students midterm work would be interrupted. Regardless, the
problems this design flaw introduced outweighed the risks.

![rpx-queue-3](/api/public/static/079fde3fe6191089)

The first step was changing all the places that rpc functions are called so that they
specified a queue to place the job in. I choose there to be a &apos;default&apos;,
and &apos;theia&apos; queues. In the interest of consolidation, I had from the start put
all the RPC functions into a single file. All that needed to be done here was specify
either default or theia queue for each of these functions.

The next step is adding a second worker pool for the theia queue. This is pretty much
just copy and paste the kubernetes yaml definition for the rpc-default deployment
and find-replace &apos;default&apos; with &apos;theia&apos;.

![rpx-both](/api/public/static/ee5af57fa37971ce)
The last step is by far the most important. <b>Testing everything.</b> I loaded
Anubis up into a minikube cluster locally and made sure everything was working right.
Cloud IDEs were getting created right. So were bulk regrades and submission processing
jobs.

#### Deploying the Patch

Once I was as confident as I could be, I did the deploy. It was a helm upgrade, then
a rolling restart of all the components that changed. The worker pools, and the api.
It seems that no matter how long I do these types of deploys, they never get comfortable.
It is almost like the more deploys I do, the more stressful they become.

![deployment-anxiety](/api/public/static/b67a5c186ab65ce2)

The deploy itself only took about a minute. The thing that took the longest was
the nodes pulling the updated images from the registry. Thankfully, everything just worked.
The old RPC worker pool was replaced with the two new ones. The RPC function calls were properly
putting jobs in the right place. This new arrangement alleviated the issues immediately.
Students could start their IDEs with no delay, and I could do my bulk regrades.
