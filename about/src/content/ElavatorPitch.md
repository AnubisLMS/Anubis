description: Assignment in Anubis work unlike any other homework solution. In most college classes, when students finish their work, they turn in a final copy into the professor. With Anubis, we eliminate this process by making it so that students turn in their homework simply by working on it.

#### What you gain by using Anubis

There are 4 main benefits

- Students can edit and run their code right in their browser. No class VMs, nothing to install.
- Students get live feedback on their answers `before` the deadline
- The feedback given to students is then used to help speed up TAs grading
- The data generated by the platform can be used to get insight into everything from which things the class is struggling with to when students actually start and how long they spend on an assignment

For the Introduction to Operating Systems course, the combination of these
benefits both from the perspective of the student and TA has resulted in
an overall increase in the average grade of the class. The feedback the
students get help them to see where their errors are before they hand in
their work. Then the usage data generated by the platform helps the TAs and
professor make decisions about which material students are and are not
understanding.

At its core, Anubis is a tool to give students live feedback from their homework
assignments
while they are working on them. Using [Github Classrooms](https://classroom.github.com/)
each student gets their
own repo from a template
for each homework assignment. The way students then submit their work
is simply by pushing their work to their repo before the deadline. Students can
then push, and therefore submit as many times as
they would like before the deadline.

#### Anubis Cloud IDEs

New in version v2.2.0, there is now the Anubis Cloud IDE. Using some
kubernetes magic, we are able to
host [Theia](https://theia-ide.org/) servers for individual students.
These are essentially VSCode instances
that students can access in the browser. What makes these so powerful
is that students can access a terminal
and type commands right into a bash shell which will be run in the
remote container. With this setup students
have access to a fully insulated and prebuilt linux
environment at a click of a button. These environments are easily customizable
for the needs of the class or even individual assignments. Because these
IDE servers are light weight docker containers we can support
many more students than if we used VMs. There are ~130 students in the Intro
to OS course in spring of 2021, and we could support all of them
using IDEs at the same time while still processing all the submissions that
come through.

As we are giving students access to a terminal in the cloud, we must also lock
down their environment. All student IDEs are limited in the RAM, CPU, storage,
and networking. From the IDEs, students are only able to connect to Github to
submit their work.

#### Assignments on Anubis

When a student pushes to their assignment repo, a job is launched on the Anubis
cluster. That job will build
their repo, run tests on the results, and store the results in a database.

Students can then navigate to the Anubis website, where
they will sign in through NYU SSO.
From there,
they will be able to see all the current and past assignments,
and all of their submissions. They are able
to view the results of the build and tests for each submission.
There they can request a regrade,
there by launching a new submission pipeline. While the submission
still being processed, the website will poll
the backend for updates. In this, the website will be constantly
updating while the submission is being
processed, giving a live and interactive feel to the site. Once
a submission is processed Anubis will show
the students logs from their tests, and builds along with which
tests passed and which failed.

#### Usage Data

Given the structure of Anubis assignments, coupled with the Anubis Cloud IDEs
track and measure when students start and finish their assignments, and how long
it takes them to pass specific tests. In the autograde results panel, a &quot;visual
history&quot; is generated for each student. It shows when students started their
assignment, then for each submission if their build passed or failed and how many
tests passed. If they used the Anubis Cloud IDEs as most students do choose to, then
the graph generated shows a _near minute by minute_ representation of which challenges
they faced and how long it took for them to overcome them.

![student assignment visual history](/api/public/static/000e6a27e2f9a14d)

> This example shows the build as the green line, and the assignment tests as the blue line.
> We can see that this student spent a good deal of time on the first day just getting their
> tests to pass, only to revisit their work the next day probably to clean up their submission.

Then more generally Anubis can represent how the class as a whole did on
the assignment. One of the core visuals generated is what we call the
&quot;summary sundial&quot;. In this sundial, we can
show a quick view of how well the class did on the assignment.

![Sundial](/api/public/static/a9e88ca0a6b55d34)

> The sundial shows how many students submitted work, and which test had the most cases pass.
> This assignment had 5 autograde tests. The inner purple radial represents all the students that
> submitted work for this assignment. Then each of the outer 5 blue radials represents an assignment
> test. Then the most outside layer shows in green and red how many students passed, and failed
> that test. We can hover over an element to get a more detailed look.

#### Autograding

The generated autograde results are available to TAs and Professors all
from the Anubis admin panel. Student results are automatically indexed
searchable. Having these results greatly increase the speed that TAs
grade.

something that can benefit your class!
