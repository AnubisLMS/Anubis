Description: # Anubis CLI
        
        ## Install
        To install the anubis cli, clone then navigate to the Anubis repo in the terminal.
        You can then pip install the cli with either `make acli` or `sudo pip3 install ./acli`. 
        Verify that the cli was installed by running `anubis -h`.
        
        
        ## Usage 
        There are several functions built into the cli so you can manage some functions of the 
        Anubis cluster on your own. You will be prompted for a username password when using the cli
        for the first time. The credentials that you use will be saved locally, so you will not be
        prompted after the first time.
        
        ```
        usage: Anubis CLI [-h] [-d] [-u AUTH_USERNAME] [-p AUTH_PASSWORD] {logout,ls,student,restart,stats,dangling} ...
        
        positional arguments:
          {logout,ls,student,restart,stats,dangling}
            logout              delete credentials
            ls                  list currently running / pending submissions
            student             students/re-enqueue submission jobs
            restart             restart/re-enqueue submission jobs
            stats               view submission stats for an assignment
            dangling            attempt to repair dangling submissions
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -d, --debug           debug mode (connect on localhost)
          -u AUTH_USERNAME, --user AUTH_USERNAME
                                specify user email
          -p AUTH_PASSWORD, --password AUTH_PASSWORD
                                specify user password
        ```
        
        
        ### Logout of cli
        To delete your saved cli credentials, run `anubis logout`.
        
        
        ### Dangling submissions
        Anubis needs to be able to match a github username to a netid. If and when a job request comes in
        for a github username that has no matching netid, a so called "dangling" submission will be created.
        Basically the submission is recorded, but it is not processed by the cluster. Uploading the missing 
        student data will fix dangling submissions.
        
        
        ### Student data
        To upload student data to anubis, use the student command. First, make a json file that has this shape:
        
        ```
        [
          {
            "netid": "jmc1283",
            "first_name": "John",
            "last_name": "Cunniff",
            "github_username": "jmc1283"
          }
        ]
        ```
        
        You can add as many student to this array as you need. When you push this data to Anubis, it will
        also attempt to fix dangling submissions.
        
        ```bash
        anubis student <filename>
        ```
        
        ```
        usage: Anubis CLI student [-h] [filename]
        
        positional arguments:
          filename    json file of student data
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help  show this help message and exit
        ```
        
        ### Restart / re-enqueue a submission
        To re-enqueue a submission, use the restart command. This command takes a netid, and optinally a commit hash.
        Without the commit option, the api will just re-enqueue the most recent submission for that netid.
        
        ```bash
        anubis restart jmc1283
        anubis restart jmc1283 2bc7f8d636365402e2d6cc2556ce814c4fcd1489
        ```
        
        ```
        usage: Anubis CLI restart [-h] netid [commit]
        
        positional arguments:
          netid       netid of student to restart
          commit      git commit hash to re-enqueue
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help  show this help message and exit
        ```
        
        ### Submission Stats
        To get the statistics for an assignment, you can use the stats command. Provide this command with an
        assignment name, and it will run though all processed submissions, getting the best submission for a netid.
        The best submission is determined to be the most recent submission with the most tests passing. 
        
        To get the statistics for say os3224-assignment-2,
        
        ```bash
        anubis stats os3224-assignment-2
        ```
        
        You can also get statstics for a single netid with
        ```bash
        anubis stats os3224-assignment-2 jmc1283
        ```
        
        ```
        usage: Anubis CLI stats [-h] assignment [netid]
        
        positional arguments:
          assignment  name of assignment
          netid       netid to view
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help  show this help message and exit
        ```
        
        ### List processing submission
        Use the ls command to verify if a submission is actually being enqueued. You may need to be speady with running
        this command. It will only show submissions that are currently in a processing state. Jobs will be processed very 
        quickly, so your window for seeing it in a processing state may only be a few seconds.
        
        ```bash
        anubis ls
        ```
