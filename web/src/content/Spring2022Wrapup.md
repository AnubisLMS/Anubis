#### Spring 2022 Wrap Up

This semester saw Anubis grow faster than ever before. There were days when we here on the
Anubis team were watching the platform break usage records every single day. We thought 
it might be fun to revisit some numbers we did this semester.

#### Github & Open Source Growth

At the Anubis project we believe very strongly in the importance of free and 
open source software. As such we made the project open source a little over a year ago.
Since then our presence on github has grown considerably. We have 280 stars now, and 
22 contributors. Most contributors are students just like you and me! Most of the student
contributors are in a computer related discipline at NYU Tandon, but we also had a few 
contributors from the NYU College of Arts and Sciences. Hopefully next year we can start 
to offer Anubis as a service to some courses at CAS too!

This semester two teams from the Professor Callahan's Software Engineering course
also worked closely with Teo Nys. The five of them used Anubis as their senior
design project.

#### User Growth

This semester we grew from 685 users in January to an astounding 1041 users by May. Anubis
has been around for 4 semesters now. This means that we nearly doubled our user count in
a single semester.

#### User retention

Along with graining users, we had more people using Anubis regularly than ever before.
Our new playgrounds service has brought the Anubis IDEs to the masses. Anyone with an
NYU netid can sign in and launch an IDE.

This convenience has lead to a huge boost in the number of people that regularly visit our 
platform. Last semester the most users we had use an IDE was just over 150. This semester
our peak day saw 250 users use Anubis. Considering the size of NYU Tandon that is about
25% of the entire school of engineering!

Students spent a lot of time working in IDEs as well. If we take the number of minutes 
each IDE was used this semester, and add them all together we found that students spent
an incredible _3 year and 40 weeks_ in Anubis IDEs this semester. That's a lot of homework 
to get through!

#### Autograding

Most students that use Anubis only use it for our IDEs, though we do have a few courses
that use the autograding features of Anubis too. 

The undergrad Operating Systems course with professor Sandoval had a busy year with 5 assignment,
a midterm and a final exam all on Anubis. Some jumps in submissions right before the 
deadline show that a few students may have some time management issues. Yikes!

Similarly, the graduate Operating Systems course with Professor Kamen used Anubis for autograding
as well. Their graphs are less exciting because it looks like the graduate students like to
start their homeworks early.

All of this autograding wasn't free though. In total, we processed _98,081 submissions_ this
semester. Too bad we fell just short of 100,000 submissions. I have faith in breaking this record
next semester though.

#### Contributors & Thanks

The growth of Anubis and the creation of the AnubisLMS project could not have happened
without our community of developers that give their free time to make the platform better
and grow to a size we never could have predicted.

So lastly I would like to thank all the people that contributed to the project in one way 
or another. Here are those amazing code warriors that made it happened
